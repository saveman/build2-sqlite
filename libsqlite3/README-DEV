This document describes how the libsqlite3 library was packaged for build2. In
particular, this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream
version. See ../README-DEV for general notes on SQLite packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files into libsqlite3/:

$ mkdir libsqlite3
$ pushd libsqlite3
$ ln -s ../../upstream/{sqlite3.c,sqlite3ext.h,sqlite3.h} .

Also fix warnings that pop up with -Wall:

$ mv sqlite3.c sqlite3.c.orig
$ cp sqlite3.c.orig sqlite3.c
$ git apply ../fix-warnings.patch
$ popd

Note that patches are produced by commands similar to the following:

$ git diff >fix-warnings.patch
